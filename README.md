**Illuminati Database:**
Assignment of Databases Course 2023-2024 - Electrical and Computer Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTh)


**1st deliverable:**
Complete theoretical implementation of a relational database: User Requirements, Entity-Relationship Modeling, Relational Schema (Overview), and Basic Queries
This deliverable focuses on the initial stages of database design. It encompasses:

* **User Selection and Requirements Analysis:** Defining target users, their specific needs, and associated access privileges.
* **Entity-Relationship (ER) Modeling:** Creation of an ER model illustrating key entities, their attributes (including primary and foreign keys), cardinalities (e.g., 1:N), relationships between entities, and the corresponding ER diagram.
* **Relational Schema:** The blueprint for how the database will be structured in tables. It defines the tables, their features and the relationships between these tables, derived from the ER model.
* **Views and Basic Queries:** Implementation of preliminary database views and simple query examples demonstrating fundamental set operations (Intersection, Union, Join operations) to combine data from multiple tables.


**2nd deliverable:**
Practical implementation of database using MySQL Workbench based on requirements and rules of the 1st deliverable.
